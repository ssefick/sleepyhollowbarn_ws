chapter1_title: "The J.C. Stribling Era Historic Significance"
chapter1_text: "Built in the late 1890s, the J.C. Stribling Barn was a pioneer of its time. As one of the first brick barns in South Carolina, it served as the heart of a 44-acre working farm that has remained a landmark in Clemson for generations.
\n\n
The J.C. Stribling Barn, constructed by Jesse Cornelius Stribling, stands out for its rare brick construction and late-Victorian architectural features, including decorative brick latticework and a jerkinhead-shaped roof. The structure demonstrates an unusual example of “bank barn” design in the southeastern United States, allowing ground-level access to multiple floors built into a hillside."
